## Tutorial Intro
Welcome to the Gaster Low-Turbulence Wind Tunnel. The material for this documentation was built upon an existing user manual, compiled in 2020 by Evelien van Bockhorst, Barry Crowley, Isabella Furmarola and Marco Placidi.

This documentation outlines the user functionality of the control systems for the Gaster Low-Turbulence Wing Tunnel facility at City, University of London. This manual is intended for users of the tunnel, it is not a guide to low-turbulence wind tunnels.

The manual will cover the setup and configuration of the wind tunnel control systems, along with the setup and running of the tunnel in the different available operating methods.
